# DelphiAST_Source
A source code generator for Delphi code.

A source code generator based on DelphiAST.  
The DelphiAST code it uses it located at: https://github.com/JBontes/DelphiAST  

It takes the abstract syntax tree and reverses it back into source code.

Currently it is binary only and it does not offer any extensions to the language, yet.  
The following extensions are planned:

**Additions to the language:**

- Additional operators  (+=,-= etc)
- Operator overloading for interfaces
- Succinct syntax for closures
- Inline variable declaration
